# The Primordial Mound (Garden Palace)

[Verse]  
Up from the flood, a first green rise,
A hill, a heartbeat under the skies.
A garden on a mountain, a palace of shade,
Where lions lie gentle and swords are unmade.

[Pre-Chorus]  
From this center, worldlines bloom,
Eden the floorplan for all rooms.

[Chorus]  
From mound to the margins, grow,
Borders learn to glow.
Ouroboros rings the round,
Keeping sanctuary sound.
Earth, takes shape, many lands.
From the middle, love expands,

[Verse]  
Four bright rivers lace the plain,
Every path a hymn to rain.
Start with a garden, end with one too,
In the circle of mercy, all things are new.

[Pre-Chorus]
A refuge for rest, sanctuary of glow,
Made to reality, as above, so below.

[Chorus]  
From mound to the margins, grow,
Borders learn to glow.
Ouroboros rings the round,
Keeping sanctuary sound.
Earth, takes shape, many lands.
From the middle, love expands.
