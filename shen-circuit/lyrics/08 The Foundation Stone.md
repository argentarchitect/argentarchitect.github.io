# The Foundation Stone

[Verse]
Drive the pegs in, set the line,
Press the scaled ones to the brine.
Temen under Egal, hammered through,
Serpent sealed in the Apsu blue.

[Pre-Chorus]
Center the compass, still the spin,
Drop the plumb deep; let order win.

[Chorus]
At the heart of the world, a stone,
Where heaven and the deep are sewn.
On that weight the ages grow,
From root to roof, let rivers flow.
Hold the middle, the pattern stays,
Shift that heart and the world unlays.

[Verse]
Enki's seal in the mason's hands,
Stone that dams the buried sands.
When the mouth is stopped, the deeps lie still,
Every tide bends to the mountain's will.

[Pre-Chorus]
Center the compass, still the spin,
Drop the plumb deep; let order win.

[Chorus]
At the heart of the world, a stone,
Where heaven and the deep are sewn.
On that weight the ages grow,
From root to roof, let rivers flow.
Hold the middle, the pattern stays,
Shift that heart and the world unlays.
