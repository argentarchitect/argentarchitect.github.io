# Exile of the Serpent

[Verse]
A son of light, but burning eyes;
Reached for the throne.
Breaker rise, glittering lies,
Council sees the shadow.

[Pre-Chorus]
Scaled question, curled deep,
Cast him down, never to sleep.

[Chorus]
Out to the chaos you go!
Outer dark where wild rivers flow.
Bite the night; the law holds fast.
But for us, high winds
Raise the mast.

[Post-Chorus]
Get to the deep, down to the deep.

[Verse]
Thrash in Tehom, rattle in Nun,
Boundary holds like a ring of sun.
Banishment of mercy's art;
Turn and learn the lawful heart.

[Bridge]
Gone from the council, his glow,
Mourned beyond the wall.
Light withheld; love still calls.

[Chorus]
Out to the chaos you go!
Outer dark where wild rivers flow.
Bite the night; the law holds fast.
But for us, high winds,
Raise the mast.
