# The Brooding Wind

[Verse]
Over, a wing beats slow,
A breath from the mouth that taught winds to blow.
Shu born like a sneeze, four corners awake,
The vortex begins, the stillness breaks.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every leaf of the universe shivers in that sweep,
From surface to subatomic, the breath runs deep.

[Chorus]
Brood, O wind, circle and sing,
Turn the ocean like a wedding ring.
Spin the storm into spiral grace,
Trace the temple in open space.
Breathe on the dust, whisper to bone,
Fill the emptiness; make it your own.

[Verse]
North, south, east, west - one breath, four roads,
The hurricane dances, the star-fields unfold.

[Outro]
What you touch remembers life,
Even stone finds pulse and light.
