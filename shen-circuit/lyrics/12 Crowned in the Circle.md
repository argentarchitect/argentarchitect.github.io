# Crowned in the Circle

[Verse]
They set a throne on newborn height,
Cartouche halo, ropes of light.
The name inscribed, a ring so round,
Uraeus watching, the temple-crowned.

[Pre-Chorus]
Because he kept the straightest line,
They hand him scepter, rod, and sign.

[Chorus]
Long live the king who loves the law,
Whose breath makes blossom all our awe.
In Shen-ring shelter, prenomen bright,
He wears the sunrise like a right.

[Verse]
Benben glitters beneath his seat,
A mountain of promise under his feet.
Kingship is service, the law in bloom,
A garden inside every room.

[Chorus]
Long live the king who loves the law,
Whose breath makes blossom all our awe.
Ruling not by iron, but by grace,
A circle of safety 'round every place.

Round every place
Every place
