# The Beloved Volunteer

[Verse]  
An ancient age, no dust, no dawn,
In council where the gods are from,
A figure stands, his purpose plain,
I'll face the dragon, break its chains.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Not for the glory, not for a throne,
But so the house of light is sown.

[Chorus] 
Here am I, send me through,
If love's a sword, then make it true.
Grant me the words that order brings,
I'll quiet the sea; ignite the springs.
...
For you... I'll plant a sun,
I volunteer until it's done.

[Verse]  
Council agrees, their sure as stars,
Authority shared, united hearts,
Courage, the silence after "Yes",
Destiny takes its first full breath.

[Chorus]
Here am I, send me through,
If love's a sword, then make it true.
Grant me the words that order brings,
I'll quiet the sea; ignite the springs.

For you... I'll plant a sun,
I volunteer until it's done.
