# Armory of Heaven (Ring Dance)

[Verse]
A net from a father, a bow made of light,
A mace with a memory, a spear for the night.
Boots that outrun the rumor of dread,
A circle of dancers to tangle its head.

[Pre-Chorus]
Round the sacred tree they turn,
Feet like prayers, hearts that burn.

[Chorus]
Draw the cord, stretch the ring,
Stamp the ground until it sings.
Swing the blade, the dragon hears,
Tie the storm with the net of years.
Weapons gleam, but love's the art,
The ring dance binds the serpent's heart.

[Verse]
Left foot, right foot, compass spun,
Four winds lock, nowhere to run.
Arm me with rhythm, crown me with right,
Ritual become the fight.

[Chorus]
Round the stone, we braid the ring,
Hundred heels make thunder sing.
One bright word, and chaos hears,
Linked hands cast the net of years.
Weapons gleam, but love's the art,
The ring dance binds the serpent's heart.
