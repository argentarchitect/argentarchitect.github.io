# Earth, Come Forth

[Verse]
"Gather", he says, and the waters lean;
"Rise", he says, and the hills are green.
From raft on the deep to reeds at the shore,
Forests answer, fields implore.

[Pre-Chorus] 
Dry land listens like a child,
Cracks its smile, growing wild.

[Chorus] 
Earth, come forth from the blue,
Wear the sun, drink the dew.
Rivers run to the edges four,
Every road a living door.
Stone by stone, day by day,
He sings the firmament into clay.

[Verse]  
Grain like starlight, orchards like choirs,
Soil holds memory of heavenly fires.
Creation is kindness learning to speak,
Abundance for strong, mercy for weak.

[Chorus]  
Earth, come forth from the blue,
Wear the sun, drink the dew.
Rivers run to the edges four,
Every road a living door.
Stone by stone, day by day,
He sings the firmament into clay.
