# Law Above Entropy (Ma'at Keeps Time)

[Verse]  
There's a law that drags the candle down,
Ash from flame, rust from crown.
But there's a higher rightness, straight as plumb,
Where order drums, the cosmos hums.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Call it Ma'at, Tzedek, Rita, Dao,
Truth sets level and lifts us now.

[Chorus]  
Rightness reverse the slide,
Turn the tide, turn the tide.
When heart is feather-light,
Chaos loses, day expels night.
Hold the line that holds the stars,
Ma'at keeps time, and heals all scars.

[Verse]  
Where justice stands, the second law bends,
Entropy falters, order ascends.
Walk straight path, glow from within,
Rightness the engine, that never dims.

[Chorus]  
Rightness reverse the slide,
Turn the tide, turn the tide.
When heart is feather-light,
Chaos loses, day expels night.
Hold the line that holds the stars,
Ma'at keeps time, and heals all scars.
