# The Egg and the Sunbird

[Verse]
Crack in the hush, gold yolk of a world,
Shell splits wide, phoenix-wing unfurled;
Light floods out like a river, brave and new.

[Pre-Chorus]
From bird on Benben to spark in our chest, creation says yes.

[Chorus]
Break, cosmic egg, spill day on the foam,
Sunbird, rise and call us home.
Let silver shell give sky its name,
We hatch with the heavens, feathered in flame.

[Verse]
Night clings like dew to stone,
But the bird's bright cry names what's known.

[Bridge]
From cracking, not keeping, our brightest futures leap.
