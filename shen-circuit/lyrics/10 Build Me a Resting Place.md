# Build Me a Resting Place

[Verse]
Dragon's shadow on the sea,
Battle scars in majesty.
Through the haze He cast His gaze
No resting throne, no holy place.

[Chorus]
So He called the calm to rise,
Set a home beneath the skies.
Built a place for Him above,
Wove the world for those He loves.

[Verse]
Stormlight fading on the deep,
King in search of peace to keep.
From the wild, He cleared the night,
Made space for joy, made room for light.

[Bridge]
From the broken waves He rose, 
Crowned the heavens where light glows. 

[Chorus]
So He called the calm to rise,
Set a home beneath the skies.
Built a place for Him above,
Wove the world for those He loves.
