# Song of the Primordial Sea

[Verse]
No sky yet, no shore, just a hush without a name,
An endless black-blue ocean of elements unchained.
Nun, Apsu, Tehom - three faces of the same,
A cradle and a chaos, a womb before the flame.

[Pre-Chorus]
I float on the unformed, a heartbeat in the deep,
Where possibility is rising from its sleep.

[Chorus]
Out of the water where the world begins,
I hear tomorrow inside the winds.
Chaos is only a seed in the sea,
Waiting for order to set it free.
I'm learning to breathe where no breath has been,
The first light flickers; let the making begin.

[Verse]
No borders but the yearning, like rain before it falls,
A galaxy of micro-eddies whispering through the halls.
The sea is heavy silence, but you can almost hear
The syllables of future lifting out of fear.

[Bridge]
Call it birthwater, call it midnight's skin,
Even in the dark, the dawn leans in.

[Chorus]
Out of the water where the world begins,
I hear tomorrow inside the winds.
Chaos is only a seed in the sea,
Waiting for order to set it free.
I'm learning to breathe where no breath has been,
The first light flickers; let the making begin
