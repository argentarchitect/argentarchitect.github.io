# Divine Utterance (Say the World)

[Verse]
Word first, not hand.
Sound flows; forms stand.
Wild hears then knows.

[Pre-Chorus]
Name it and order shows.

[Chorus]
Say, world, turns.
Breath, fire, burns.
Lines align.
From nun, light shines.
Divine utterance,
Make the design.

[Verse]
He sings; night keeps time.
All the atoms rhyme.
Word wakes; land and seas.

[Chorus]
Say, world, turns.
Breath, fire, burns.
Lines align.
From nun, light shines.
Divine utterance,
Make the design.
